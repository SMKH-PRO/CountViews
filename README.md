Pure JavaScript (No Server Side Language like php, just using some strong javascript apis) 
 
With this views counting system, you can count each and every real views on your website/video or pictures!


How It Works?
We are using firebase database that allow us to store data into database using JavaScript so everytime a user visit our website, we are getting his ip address using an API and then we are storing it in our firebase database so on every visit we will be checking in our database if the ip address exist or not if not then we will not count it as a view!

Special Features:-

It will check if user is a returning user or a new user, 
and if a user is a new user then we will count his view 
and store his ip address in our database!
